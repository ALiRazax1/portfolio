      TypeScript vs. JavaScript: Key Differences</h1>
    <p>In the world of modern web
      development, JavaScript has long reigned supreme. It's everywhere—from
      client-side web apps to server-side environments like Node.js. But
      recently, more and more developers are switching from JavaScript to
      TypeScript. So, why should you consider making the switch? Let’s break it
      down.</p>
       <h2 className="text-xl md:text-2xl xl:text-3xl pb-3 pt-10 text-blue-500 underline">What is TypeScript?</h2>
     <p> TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds
      static types. This means you can define the type of variables, function
      arguments, and return values. TypeScript code is transpiled into
      JavaScript, making it fully compatible with existing JS codebases.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl md:text-2xl xl:text-3xl pb-3 pt-10 text-blue-500 underline">Key Differences</h2>
       <p>Type Safety: JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which
      means that type errors can sneak in and might not be caught until runtime.
      TypeScript, on the other hand, offers compile-time type checking, making
      it easier to catch bugs early. Better Tooling: With TypeScript, your
      editor can give you auto completion and better refactoring tools.
      IntelliSense, anyone? Maintainability: TypeScript makes it easier to work
      on large-scale projects. With strongly-typed code, teams can manage more
      complex codebases without worrying about breaking functionality in hidden
      corners.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl md:text-2xl xl:text-3xl pb-3 pt-10 text-blue-500 underline"> Why Switch to TypeScript?</h2>
       <p> Reduced Errors: TypeScript can catch
      many errors early in the development process, making your code more
      reliable. Scalability: For large codebases, TypeScript’s strictness makes
      maintaining code much easier. Better Developer Experience: Enhanced
      tooling, error detection, and readability mean a smoother developer
      experience.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl md:text-2xl xl:text-3xl pb-3 pt-10 text-blue-500 underline">Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Switching to TypeScript might take a little getting
      used to, but in the long run, it can significantly boost your development
      speed, code quality, and team collaboration. Why not give it a try?</p>
